            OperatorHub.io is front-end for the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={operatorsRepo} text="Community Operator Registry" indicator={false} />, an open source
            community project aiming to curate and collect Kubernetes Operators. If you have an Operator you would like
            to contribute to OperatorHub.io, it’s easy to get started. Community contributions will live in a{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={contributions} text="GitHub repository" indicator={false} /> and will be accepted via
            pull requests against that directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The easiest way to package your Operator for OperatorHub.io is to build it with the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={operatorSdk} text="Operator SDK" indicator={false} />, however it is not a requirement.
            To publish you Operator, it must be a binary deployed in a container and that container must be hosted on a
            publicly accessible registry. It should be{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={addingYourOperator} text="accompanied" indicator={false} /> by some metadata that is
            used for deploying the Operator using the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" indicator={false} /> in addition to rendering the
            Operator’s detail page on OperatorHub.io.
          </p>
        </React.Fragment>
      )
    },
    {
      title: `Package your Operator`,
      content: (
        <React.Fragment>
          <p>
            Your Operator should be able to be managed by the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={olm} text="Operator Lifecycle Manager" indicator={false} /> (OLM). This component of the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={gettingStarted} text="Operator Framework" indicator={false} /> is deployed on your
            Kubernetes cluster and will be able to install the Operator via CLI or through a GUI component like embedded
            OperatorHub in OpenShift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, this requires some catalog data to be created in the form of YAML manifests that follow a
            specific directory structure. Let’s take a look at an example from the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={contributions} text="community repository" indicator={false} />:
          </p>
          <p>
            Your catalog data should live in a flat directory named after your Operator, e.g. the following files exist
            for the <ExternalLink href={prometheusOperator} text="Prometheus Operator" indicator={false} /> in a
            directory called <code>prometheus</code>.
          </p>
          {renderTable()}
          <p>
            This catalog data will enable OLM to serve, install and update your Operator in a predictable way instead of
            having users manually deploy the required manifests that contain CRDs, RBAC rules, Service Accounts,
            Deployments etc. If you want to learn more about how OLM does this, read about it{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={olmArchitecture} text="here" indicator={false} />.
          </p>
          <h3>Custom Resource Definitions:</h3>
          <p>
            These should already exist if your Operator watches Custom Resource Definitions. Place every CRD that your
            Operator owns in it’s own YAML file. CRDs that your Operator does not own but watches are handled by OLMs
            dependency management.
          </p>
          <h3>Cluster Service Version:</h3>
          <p>
            The main part is in the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) file, of which there is one per version of your
            Operator. This file’s specified description, logo, version, maturity level, authoring info, links etc. will
            be used to render on OperatorHub.io. Follow these instructions to create this file:
          </p>
          <p>
            The ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) file, of which there is one per version of your Operator. This file contains
            the specifications of how to deploy your Operator, information which CRDs it owns and which it depends on
            from other Operator. In addition this is where you put in a description, logo, version, maturity level,
            authoring info, links etc of your Operator. This information will be used to render the detail page on
            OperatorHub.io. Follow these instructions to create this file:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ExternalLink href={buildYourCSV} text={buildYourCSV} indicator={false} />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you add files for newer versions of your Operator don’t forget to use the replaces property to point to
            the previous version.
          </p>
          <h3>Package Manifest:</h3>
          <p>
            The package manifest is a simple list of software channels that point to the most current CSV. This allows
            your users to serve the Operator from multiple channels, e.g. stable and alpha to convey stability and
            update frequency. You need to have at least one channel. For reference, use one of the examples in the{' '}
            <ExternalLink href={contributions} text="community repository" indicator={false} />.
          </p>
          <p>Feel free to use existing Community Operators catalog data as a template.</p>

            If you are developing your Operator with the Operator SDK you can simply create most of this catalog data by
